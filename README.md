This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* measurements for the dissipator project

### measurement configuration

### list of measurements ###

* dissipator T1

* cavity ring down time sweeping FFL drive amplitude and readout pulse amplitude
* cavity ring-down time as a function of FFL drive frequency (and with FFL drive frequency deliberately off-calibrated)
* photon-number resolved spectroscopy
